# virtualenvstarter
an extremely basic scaffold for getting a simple virtualenv project going

**OBSOLETE**
------
The new way to do this is easy (in Python3).  We no longer need much assistance at all:
- `python3 -m venv venv`

Then:
- `./venv/bin/pip install <whatever-you-want1>`
- `./venv/bin/pip install <whatever-you-want2>`
- `./venv/bin/pip install <whatever-you-want3>`

Then:
- `./venv/bin/python3 mywork.py`

Or:
- `./venv/bin/activate`
- `python mywork.py`

To Use
------
- make a folder
- unzip this project into it
- run ./setupdevenv.sh
- delete this readme and license file and happy working

To Clean
--------
- run ./clean.sh
